# Warehouse Robot Project

## Instruction
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git clone
git status
git add
git commit
git push
```

Please remeber to **create your own development branch** before starting to make any change to the code. You can work on a feature branch to make changes safely. Then, you can:
* later use ```git push``` to share your branch with the remote repository
* open a pull request to compare the changes with your collaborators
* test and deploy as needed from the branch
* merge into the main branch.
